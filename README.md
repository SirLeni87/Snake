## My approach to Snake.
Many programmers at some point of their education decide to create a simple game of Snake, and so did I, but I went a bit further.

### This game can be played in singleplayer or in PvP.

**Singleplayer** presents itself as a basic and widely known Snake with new graphics and simple difficulty choosing mechanism. The harder the difficulty, the faster the snake accelerates. On chillout difficulty it doesn't accelerate at all. The goal is to get to be 20 segments long.

**PvP** is a hotseat game for two players. Again the goal is to get as long as 20 segments, or to make the opponent hit an obstacle. This mode is additionally full of game changing modifiers, that make the game really interesting.

## Controls

#### Player 1
Change direction with `WASD` in both single and multiplayer.
If you have a shell (in PvP), shoot with `spacebar`

### Player 2
Change direction with `arrow keys`.
If you have a shell (in PvP), shoot with `right ctrl`
